=====Ideas====
1. Data collection using INCOIS API on the above parameters.
2. Continuous monitoring and updating of suitability status based on live data.
3. Use of geospatial maps to pinpoint beaches along the Karnataka and Kerala coastlines.
4. Color Coding:
  Green: Suitable for recreational activities.
  Yellow: Caution advised; minor risks present.
  Red: Not suitable, significant risks.
5. User Notifications (If a person is present at the time of any high/low tide, we can notify him through notifications based on GPS)
6. Interactive UI
